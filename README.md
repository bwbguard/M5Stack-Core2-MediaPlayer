M5Stack Core2 Web Media Player modified from other sources



I was searching for a Streaming media player for the M5Stack Core2 and came across a M5 Stack Forum with other looking for the same thing. This forum : https://forum.m5stack.com/topic/2972/core2-as-web-radio-without-extra-hardware Got me pointed to this site that had an M5Stack media player working on the M5Stick: https://www.hackster.io/tommyho/arduino-web-radio-player-c4cb23

Code for the Core2 was 'Untested' and did not work for me.

After finding other examples that worked for playing MP3 from an SD card, the correct values were entered for a working Streaming media player.

I think it's only fair to mention that the underlying library that makes the magic happen is from this: https://github.com/earlephilhower/ESP8266Audio

I've updated the GUI to make it slightly nicer to use.

No special licensing other than what is required by the listed sources above, or Arduino.
My additions are free to use for all. Enjoy.
